# 🏡 Homestay Booking Platform – Final Year Project

This is a homestay booking web application developed using React. It simulates the functionality of platforms like Airbnb, allowing users to browse units, view image galleries, select dates, and submit booking inquiries.

This project is created as part of a Final Year Project submission.

## IMPORTANT ## 
As my source code folder is too big to be submmited in one folder I have seperated to three folder. 
Step 1: Download all three foldler and unzip it 
Step 2: Copy and paster all the content in folder "Images2" into folder "Images" 
Step 3: Drag the **WHOLE** folder of "Images" in the "Images" folder to folder "finalyearproject 20416044 -> "src".

## 📁 Folder Contents

After extracting the `.zip`, you should see the following structure:

finalyearproject/
├── public/
├── src/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json


✅ `node_modules/` and `build/` are **intentionally excluded** to keep the project lightweight. You will install dependencies in the next step.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### ✅ 1. Install Node.js and npm

First, ensure Node.js is installed on your machine:

- [Download Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Restart your terminal after installation

Check if installation was successful:

npm -v

### ✅ 2. Open the Project in Terminal
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate into the extracted project folder:
cd path/to/finalyearproject

### ✅ 3. Install Dependencies
Install all necessary packages using:
npm install --force
This reads from package.json and creates a node_modules/ folder locally.

### ✅ 4. Run the Application
Once installation is done, start the app:
npm start
This launches the development server and opens the app at:
http://localhost:3000

If you face any issues running the project, please ensure:

Node.js is correctly installed

You are inside the project folder before running commands

You’ve run npm install before npm start
